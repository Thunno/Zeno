# Zeno

An Thunno 2 interpreter for Mac/Linux machines. **Note: this hasn't been tested on Windows, but it probably won't work**

## Introduction

According to Bing,

> Zeno is a cool and mysterious name that evokes the paradoxes of Zeno of Elea,
> a Greek philosopher who challenged the notions of motion and infinity.

So I just went with that as the name for the interpreter.

## Setup

You can install Zeno from PyPI:

```
pip install thunno-zeno
```

This command will install all the required dependencies.

## Running

You can start the interpreter by using the `zeno` command.

From there, type in your code. You can use the following commands:

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> = switch to code
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd> = switch to flags
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>G</kbd> = switch to inputs
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>H</kbd> = show the help message
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> = run the code

The code will be highlighted automatically.

## Screenshot

This is from after pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> to run the code
